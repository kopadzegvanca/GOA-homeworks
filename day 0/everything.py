#Python is one of the most popular and useful languages used to give instructions to computers.

#Python has a simple syntax which means it's easy to write, read and learn!
print("Welcome")
#The print() instruction is the easiest way to send a message to the screen or other display device.
print("Level Up!")
#The print() instruction requires the use of parentheses() around the message.
#Make sure you use quotation marks""" around the text messages.
#If you miss the quotation marks around the text the computer won't understand your instructions.

#Humans use code to give instructions to machines.

#Numbers don't require quotation marks.
print(360)





#Numerical data is information that comes in the form of numbers.
#Numerical values can be directly stored in variables.
population = 25000
#Numerical data shouldn't be in quotation marks.
points = 500
#variable name: points
#variable value: 500

#You can send a number to the screen with the print() statement. You just need to insert the number between the parentheses.
print(280)

#You can perform math operations with numbers. Each print() instruction will add a value to the screen in a new line.
print(6 + 3)
print(6 - 3)
print(6 * 3)
print(6 / 3)



#Variables are key to software development. They allow you to store, label and play with data.
#Complete the code to store the string(str) in the variable
name = "gvanca"


#You can store the result of a calculation in a variable.
score = 7 + 8
print(score)

#You can create a new variable to store the result of a calculation made using other variables.
price = 5
amount = 6
total = price * amount

#You can update the value stored in a variable. The variable will forget the previously stored value.
price = 99
price = 100
print(price)




#Coding consists of 3 steps:
# - Writing
# - Executing (or running)
# - Fixing errors (or debugging)

#Machines will refuse to follow instructions from a human if they contain mistakes.
#Even experienced programmers get coding errors (or bugs) all the time. So if you’re making mistakes, it’s ok! You’re on the right track.
#Even the tiniest typo or a misplaced tab in your code will result in an error.




#Professional developers use comments(hash symbol#) to add descriptions and explanations to their programs.


#Snake case is a popular way to create variable names in a consistent way. Snake case uses underscores _ to separate words in a variable name.
#using snake case
